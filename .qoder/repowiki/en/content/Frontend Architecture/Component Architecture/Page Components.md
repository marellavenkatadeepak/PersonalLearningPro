## Introduction
This document provides a comprehensive guide to PersonalLearningPro’s page-level components and routing structure. It covers all major pages including dashboards, authentication pages, assessment interfaces, and administrative panels. The documentation explains page composition, route protection and role-based access control, page lifecycle and data fetching patterns, integration with application state, and page-specific features such as forms, data visualization, and real-time capabilities. It also details routing configuration, navigation patterns, transitions, performance optimization strategies, and SEO considerations for educational content management.

## Project Structure
The client-side application is organized around a single-page app built with a lightweight router and a layout wrapper. Pages are grouped under a dedicated pages directory and composed from reusable UI components. Authentication is enforced at the routing level, and a layout wrapper applies consistent spacing and sidebar integration across pages.

## Core Components
- Root application and routing:
  - The application initializes React DOM and mounts the root App component.
  - App sets up providers for theme, Firebase authentication, React Query, and a global toast system.
  - A layout wrapper applies a sidebar and responsive main content area with configurable full-width mode.
  - Router enforces authentication checks and selects role-aware dashboards; otherwise, it renders the authentication dialog.
- Page wrappers:
  - Module-level memoized wrappers apply AppLayout to each page, ensuring consistent margins and responsiveness.
- Role-aware routing:
  - The root route resolves to a role-specific dashboard determined by the authenticated user’s profile.
  - Explicit routes are provided for each dashboard and feature page.

## Architecture Overview
The routing architecture uses a lightweight router to manage page-level navigation and enforce authentication. Pages are grouped by functional domain and share common UI components. Data fetching is integrated via React Query hooks within pages, and state is managed through React hooks and persisted where applicable (e.g., AI chat history).

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
participant Browser as "Browser"
participant Main as "main.tsx"
participant App as "App.tsx"
participant Router as "Router()"
participant Auth as "useFirebaseAuth()"
participant Layout as "AppLayout"
participant Page as "Page Component"
Browser->>Main : Load app
Main->>App : Render root App
App->>Router : Render routes
Router->>Auth : Check currentUser and isLoading
alt Not authenticated
Router-->>Browser : Show FirebaseAuthDialog
else Authenticated
Router->>Router : Resolve role-aware dashboard
Router->>Layout : Wrap page with AppLayout
Layout->>Page : Render page content
Page-->>Browser : Rendered page
end
```

## Dependency Analysis
- Routing and guards:
  - Router depends on Firebase auth context to decide whether to show the auth dialog or the role-aware dashboard.
  - Page wrappers depend on AppLayout for consistent spacing and sidebar integration.
- Data fetching:
  - Pages use React Query hooks; queries are configured per page and can be enabled/disabled as needed.
- UI components:
  - Pages compose reusable UI components (cards, forms, tabs, charts) from the shared component library.
- Role configuration:
  - Role-specific data mapping is centralized for demonstration and can be extended to backend-provided profiles.

## Performance Considerations
- Lazy loading:
  - Routes are pre-wrapped at module level to avoid recreating components on each render. Consider dynamic imports for heavy pages to defer bundle load.
- Rendering:
  - Use React.memo and useMemo for expensive computations within pages.
  - Virtualize long lists (e.g., student directory) to reduce DOM nodes.
- Data fetching:
  - Enable queries only when needed; leverage queryClient invalidation and background refetch strategies.
- Charts and media:
  - Lazy-load chart libraries and images; defer heavy visualizations until visible.
- Hydration and SSR:
  - For SEO, consider server-side rendering or static generation for public pages; keep interactive pages client-rendered.

## Troubleshooting Guide
- Authentication issues:
  - Ensure Firebase auth context is initialized before Router renders. Verify that the auth dialog appears when unauthenticated.
- Route resolution:
  - Confirm that the root route resolves to the correct role-aware dashboard. Check the role mapping logic in Router.
- Data fetching:
  - If queries do not load, verify query keys and enabled flags. Ensure queryClient is configured globally.
- Forms and validation:
  - For registration and login, check form submission callbacks and error handling. Validate client-side constraints.
- Chat and real-time:
  - For AI tutor, confirm API endpoint availability and network connectivity. Inspect localStorage persistence for conversations.

## Conclusion
PersonalLearningPro’s page-level architecture emphasizes role-aware routing, consistent layout wrapping, and modular UI components. Authentication is enforced at the routing layer, and pages integrate React Query for data fetching. The dashboards provide rich, role-specific experiences with charts and actionable insights. Assessment interfaces and administrative panels offer focused workflows tailored to educators and administrators. By applying lazy loading, virtualization, and careful query configuration, the application can maintain strong performance and scalability.
