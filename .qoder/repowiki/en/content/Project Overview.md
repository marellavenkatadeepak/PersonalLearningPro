## Introduction
PersonalLearningPro is an AI-powered personalized learning platform designed to enhance educational experiences through intelligent test creation, comprehensive performance analytics, and adaptive learning tools for students, teachers, administrators, and parents. The platform integrates modern technologies to deliver a seamless, real-time learning environment that supports both synchronous and asynchronous interactions, automated assessment, and AI-driven insights.

The platform’s mission is to democratize access to personalized education by combining robust backend infrastructure with a responsive frontend, enabling institutions to improve learning outcomes through data-informed strategies and AI-assisted tutoring.

## Project Structure
The repository follows a monorepo-style organization with clear separation between client, server, and shared code:
- client: React 18 frontend built with Vite, providing role-aware dashboards, AI tutoring, chat, and analytics.
- server: Express.js backend serving APIs, managing sessions, integrating OpenAI, and handling WebSocket connections.
- shared: Zod schemas and shared types used across client and server for consistent validation.
- docker-compose: Container orchestration for local development and deployment.

## Architecture Overview
The platform employs a layered architecture with clear separation of concerns:
- Frontend (React 18/Vite): Provides role-aware UIs, real-time chat, and AI tutoring.
- Backend (Express.js): Exposes RESTful APIs, manages sessions, and orchestrates integrations.
- Real-Time Communication: WebSocket servers for chat and MessagePal features.
- Data Layer: MongoDB for general user and metadata storage, Cassandra (Astra DB) for scalable message storage.
- AI Integration: OpenAI for chat, evaluation, study plan generation, and performance analysis.
- Authentication: Firebase for user authentication and profile management.

### AI Integration Flow
The AI integration is centralized in the backend and consumed by the frontend:
- AI Chat: Endpoint accepts a message array and returns a response from OpenAI.
- Answer Evaluation: Teachers can evaluate subjective answers using AI with rubrics.
- Study Plan Generation: Personalized study plans based on weak and strong topics.
- Performance Analysis: Insights into average scores, hardest questions, and recommendations.

### Real-Time Communication (WebSocket)
The backend initializes WebSocket servers for chat and MessagePal, enabling real-time messaging and collaboration:
- Chat WebSocket: Manages real-time chat events and broadcasts messages to connected clients.
- MessagePal WebSocket: Dedicated server for MessagePal features with separate routes and storage.

### Authentication and Authorization
Firebase provides authentication and user profiles, while the backend enforces role-based access control:
- Firebase Auth: Email/password and Google OAuth with Firestore user profiles.
- Session Management: Express session stores user roles and permissions.
- Role-Based Routes: Teachers can create tests; students can attempt tests; admins/principals have elevated access.

```mermaid

participant Firebase as "Firebase Auth"
participant API as "Express API"
participant Session as "Session Store"
User->>Firebase : Login/Register
Firebase-->>User : Auth token
User->>API : Request with auth
API->>Session : Set role and userId
API-->>User : Authorized response
```

- [server/routes.ts](file://server/routes.ts#L11-L85)

### Data Models and Validation
Shared Zod schemas define strict validation for requests and responses across the client-server boundary:
- User, Test, Question, TestAttempt, Answer, Analytics, Workspace, Channel, Message schemas.
- Ensures consistent data structures and reduces runtime errors.

```mermaid
erDiagram
USER {
int id PK
string username
string email
string role
string class
}
TEST {
int id PK
string title
string subject
int teacherId
string status
}
QUESTION {
int id PK
int testId
string type
string text
}
TEST_ATTEMPT {
int id PK
int testId
int studentId

}
ANSWER {

}
USER ||--o{ TEST : "creates"

TEST ||--o{ TEST_ATTEMPT : "taken_by"
TEST_ATTEMPT ||--o{ ANSWER : "contains"
```

## Performance Considerations
- Real-Time Efficiency: WebSocket servers minimize latency for chat and collaboration.
- Database Scaling: Cassandra’s partitioned design supports high-throughput message storage.
- AI Responsiveness: OpenAI requests are asynchronous; consider caching responses for repeated queries.
- Frontend Caching: React Query optimizes client-side data fetching and updates.
- Containerization: Docker Compose enables efficient local development and deployment scaling.

[No sources needed since this section provides general guidance]

## Troubleshooting Guide
Common issues and resolutions:
- Missing Environment Variables: Ensure OPENAI_API_KEY and Firebase credentials are configured; otherwise, AI features or auth will be disabled.
- Database Connectivity: MongoDB connection errors are non-fatal; verify MONGODB_URL; Cassandra requires Astra DB credentials.
- WebSocket Issues: Confirm WebSocket initialization and port exposure; verify client connectivity.
- CORS and Sessions: Validate session configuration and cookie settings for production deployments.
