## Introduction
This document describes the role-based dashboard customization system implemented in the client application. It explains how five distinct dashboard implementations serve different user roles—administrator, principal, teacher, student, and parent—each with tailored widgets, analytics, and features. It also covers dashboard layout management, widget configuration, personalization options, data sources, real-time update strategies, performance metrics display, accessibility features, responsive design, and user preference storage.

## Project Structure
The dashboard system is organized around role-aware routing and modular dashboard pages. Each role has a dedicated page component that composes reusable dashboard widgets. Authentication context determines the active role and routes users to the appropriate dashboard. Theme context manages light/dark/system preferences and applies them globally.

## Core Components
- Role-aware routing and dashboard selection:
  - The router selects the appropriate dashboard based on the authenticated user’s role.
  - Default route redirects to the role-specific dashboard.
- Authentication context:
  - Provides user profile with role metadata used for routing and personalization.
- Theme context:
  - Manages theme preference (light, dark, system) and persists it to local storage.
- Dashboard pages:
  - Each role page composes a set of widgets optimized for that role’s needs.
- Shared dashboard widgets:
  - Reusable components for charts, tables, schedules, and quick actions.

- [theme-context.tsx](file://client/src/contexts/theme-context.tsx#L23-L62)

## Architecture Overview
The system follows a role-based composition pattern:
- Authentication determines the active role.
- Router maps the role to a dashboard page.
- Dashboard page renders role-specific widgets and analytics.
- Widgets use React Query for data fetching and display mock data when endpoints are disabled.
- Theme context applies global theme preferences.

## Dependency Analysis
- Routing depends on authentication context to select the correct dashboard.
- Dashboard pages depend on shared widgets for consistent UX and data presentation.
- Widgets depend on React Query for data fetching and on theme context for visual styling.
- Theme context persists user preference to local storage and applies it to the document root.

```mermaid
graph TB
Auth["Auth Context (firebase-auth-context.tsx)"] --> Router["Router (App.tsx)"]
Router --> Dash["Role Dashboard"]
Dash --> Widgets["Shared Widgets"]

- [theme-context.tsx](file://client/src/contexts/theme-context.tsx#L23-L62)

## Performance Considerations
- Data fetching:
  - Widgets currently disable queries (enabled=false) and rely on mock data. This prevents unnecessary network requests during development and avoids blocking renders.
- Skeleton loaders:
  - Widgets provide skeleton loaders to maintain perceived performance while data is being fetched.
- Responsive charts:
  - Charts use responsive containers to adapt to screen sizes without manual breakpoints.
- Theme-aware visuals:
  - Charts adjust grid and axis colors based on theme to reduce contrast issues and improve readability.
- Layout responsiveness:
  - Dashboard pages use CSS grid and flex utilities to adapt to small, medium, and large screens.

Recommendations:
- Enable queries when backend endpoints are ready and implement caching strategies.
- Consider pagination for long lists (e.g., recent tests, top students).
- Lazy-load heavy widgets if they are not immediately visible.
- Debounce or throttle frequent updates for real-time features.

- [class-schedule.tsx](file://client/src/components/dashboard/class-schedule.tsx#L36-L39)

## Troubleshooting Guide
- Authentication issues:
  - Verify that the authentication provider is initialized and that onAuthStateChanged resolves profile data. The context includes timeouts to prevent hanging.
- Role-based routing:
  - Ensure the user profile includes a valid role. The router defaults to the teacher dashboard if the role is unrecognized.
- Widget data loading:
  - If widgets show skeletons indefinitely, confirm that the query keys match backend endpoints and that queries are enabled.
- Theme not persisting:
  - Confirm that the theme provider is wrapping the app and that localStorage keys are accessible.
- Accessibility:
  - Ensure interactive elements have proper focus styles and ARIA attributes if extended. The current UI relies on semantic HTML and Tailwind utilities.

## Conclusion
The role-based dashboard customization system provides a scalable, modular foundation for delivering distinct experiences to administrators, principals, teachers, students, and parents. Through shared widgets, role-aware routing, and theme persistence, the system balances personalization with consistency. As the platform evolves, enabling backend integrations, implementing real-time updates, and optimizing performance will further enhance the user experience across devices and preferences.
